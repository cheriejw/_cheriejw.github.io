A Day of shecurity made me realize how real sexism and agism is in the tech industry.

### Skills gained
I went on a Burp Suite track. It was so fun utilizing all of what burp suite had to offer and seeing how each tab/tool worked. There was a CTF after the Burp Suite workshop where I was on my own solving problems. Each flag made me feel so accomplished, I couldn't believe I was solving them on my own utilizing the knowledge I had gained in the last workshop.

Burp Suite (useful new tools I learned)
- Sequencer: Used to find patterns in generated tokens or keys.
- Intruder: Allows you to kind of brute force attacks.
- Spider: Crawls a web page to to kind hidden directories.
- Scanner: Automated vulnerability scan.
- Repeater: Can be used for manully playing with a request.

### Retrospective

> The whole conference made me realize how big of an impact being a minority in the tech industry actually made.

There are three conferences that I recall attending. Visual Studio Live, AWS Summit, and this: Day of Shecurity.

All of these conferences had a sponsor hall where attendees have an opportunity to speak with sponsors. During Visual Studio Live, I noticed most of the attendees were older, in business attire... while I was walking through the sponsors, none of them would aknowledge me (looking like a clueless college student), so naturally I awkwardly stood there and left without speaking or asking about products, only eavesdropped on demos.

At AWS Summit, there was a mix of 20 year olds and 40-50 year olds. Walking through the sponsor hall with my male engineer friend, there were many booths and they would reach out and talk to us, which was nice. Hearing him ask elementry questions made me feel more comfortable to converse; however, at a few booths, since he was doing most of the talking, they would ignore me all together. Noticing this, I still felt intimidated to start asking curious questions of my own.

At A Day of Shecurity, all of us were women. The environment felt so different. I did not expect it. When I walked to the sponsor hall... I didn't feel intimidated at all to ask all the questions; And that was the first time at a tech event (hackathons included) where I actually spoke to all of the sponsors and got a good general understanding of what all their businesses did. It was amazing. I felt amazing. I believe I always knew I was a minority, throught it never crossed my mind how much it effected me. I didn't realize because of this, I was in an environment where I felt uncomfortable to ask questions and grow. I always blamed it on myself, just being too shy, and that... I wasn't really interested anyway.

Thinking back this must have been the comfort that my friend must have felt at AWS Summit, where I saw him fearlessly asking what I would think to be 'stupid' questions. The whole conference made me realize how big of an impact being a minority in the tech industry actually made. I always thought people were exagerating, but it exsists.
