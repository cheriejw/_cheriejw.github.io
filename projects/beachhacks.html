	<p style="font-size: .9em; text-align: center;">BeachHacks is a 24-hour intercollegiate hackathon hosted by California State University, Long Beach.</p>
	I was Vice President of our local ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) chapter during BeachHacks 2.0 term and we were lacking a media designer for our PR content. I took on designing our logos, shirts, posters, and prospectus. You may see the content below.
