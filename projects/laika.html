<p>Have you ever used Linode? We'll make it easier for you.

We wanted to give developers an easy way to manage their virtual private servers. Instead of the user using the interface on Linode.com, they are able to quickly carry out functionality with this web app. For users that are new to using VPS's, we want to make it simple for developers getting started with Virtual Private Servers by allowing them to start a VPS we have configured for them.

The user can create, clone, boot, shutdown, delete disks, check status of any Linode Virtual Private Servers for their account. The user is given a list of datacenters where they can easily deploy Ubuntu servers. They are also able to view standard information about their account, such as how much credit they have in their account and when their account was created.</p>
